  title: "Who am I?"
  content: >
    <p class="lead">
      I am an Electronics engineer by formal training which let me question my life choices with my passion in coding,
      learning new tools, programming languages and to create projects to <strike>showoff</strike> showcase my skills 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I am a deliberate jack of all trades, master of none. My profile is a hybrid of technical and managerial experience, but always related to technological projects. I bring business and product vision to tech teams, partly thanks to having started an developed a company. 
      I am a fast learner, curious to see how technology can improve the users experience in multiple areas. I have a strong motivation and sense of responsibility with myself, my team and clients (or peers), and people like my positive and easy going, can-do attitude and my sense of humor.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    On the technical side, Iâ€™m a specialized generalist, always working between different areas and aiming to develop a holistic vision on what is involved into creating a successful tech products,dashboards and web development, ,... This has involved a variety of languages and frameworks in the web-side and datascience side.
